/**
 * In this short assessment, the following code tries to implement the React Suspense API,
 * but does so incorrectly. There are 3 core issues with how these components utilize Suspense and concurrent mode -- can you find them?
 * 
 * In your submission, be sure to:
 * 1) Clearly identify what the 3 core issues are, and how they violate the principles of React Suspense;
 * 2) Write and submit the code to fix the core issues you have identified in a gist of your own
 * 
 * If you aren't familiar with Suspense, the docs are a good starting place:
 * 
 * https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html
 * 
 * We rate each answer by comparing the submitted answer to how we would write the same code in production at Contra.
 * You are guaranteed an interview if your code ticks all the boxes. Good luck!
